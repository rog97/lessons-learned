A company should not build software until it is absolutely essential. It should try to achieve its goals through other means for example - a video describing the use case.
Once it is essential to the business to have the software, development team should aim to develop a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP must have only the essential features required.
In developing the first product, the team should work on the hardest thing first.
While specifying sofware, there is always a trade-off between time, cost and features. The business must consciously take the decision to trade off between these.
The team must also consider the bid types. An hourly bid is usually better suited than fixed bid.
