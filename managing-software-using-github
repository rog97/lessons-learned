GitHub is a powerful tool for developers to collaborate on a specific project. In a lot of ways, GitHub is like Dropbox for software development.

+The repo is like a directory or folder in the cloud. I can share this repo with others and grant them special permissions so that we can work in parallel.

+In terms of the flow, there is usually a top level or master repo. I have my own repo, and I can "fork" or essentially copy the master repo to make my own changes.

+If we were working with actual code, I would "clone" or make a local copy so that I could edit the code in my own computer (using my preferred text editor).

+Once I'm finished editing, I can "push" those changes onto my repo on GitHub.

+The last component is to submit a "pull" request. This is basically a way to tell the maintainer of whatever project I'm working on to take a look at the changes, and if she/he is cool with them, to add them to the repository.

+If you ever get stuck, [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/github) is a good place to get help.

Pretty sweet!
